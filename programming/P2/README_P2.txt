 I adapted this program and report from Summer II 2022 which I failed the course but received 100% on P2. 
When I first wrote the program I wrote it very modular and portable 
so that I could simply change some probability variables and make 
a few adaptations to the robot environment/scenario 
(as I predicted I would need to use this program for the future, turns out in 
this actual same course since I failed and also this is how I write most of my programs 
so that I can use them in the future). 
I worked very hard and did many extra screenshots 
for E and S movement with errors to demonstrate my program works 100% and that I understand very well. 
Also, my commenting is very good and thorough as I do that anyway so when I or anyone looks at my code they can follow it. As such, they are detailed enough for me to highlight my comments 
and parts of the code in my report to give details on how I implemented filtering and prediction. Thank you!

To compile:
I only have one source file and it contains the main function. Simply compile and run that single file using a c++ compiler.
